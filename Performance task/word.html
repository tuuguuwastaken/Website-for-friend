                    <h3>Dear valued parents</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">I am delighted to be writing to formally introduce myself to you, as the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of the CIA FIRST International School.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">
                        I have spent the last 16 years of my life leading schools, establishing new schools, and working in the area of school leadership and improvement in various countries throughout Asia.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">Young people are growing up today in a world that changes at ever faster rates, are more globally connected than ever before, and continually poses new challenges and offers new opportunities. The best way to support them in fulfilling their potential is through a close and committed partnership between school and families.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">I understand that you have great aspirations for your children. It is our responsibility to hear your aspirations, to apply our professional knowledge and skills to help your children to achieve their and your goals.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">CIA FIRST International School is at an exciting stage in its development. The new school at Chbar Ampov has opened and in February 2021 we will open the new High School. This will see us grow in size, but I am also determined that we take all opportunities to grow in setting high goals for what our schools can achieve for your children.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="word-ceo">The Covid-19 virus impact in the world may make it impossible to meet in large numbers together. Nevertheless, I want us to do all we can to strengthen communication between us. As part of strengthening the partnership with you, I will be writing again in a few days to share details of a series of online ‘town hall’ meetings. These will be an opportunity for parents to bring your questions.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>With warm regards
